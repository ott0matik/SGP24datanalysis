# SGP24datanalysis
Data Analysis of F1 Singapore Grand Prix 2024
This repository is the Data Analysis of  F1 SGP 2024. We used many Python libraries like Numpy, Seaborn to generate such cool visuals. We used the Laptime and pit analysis for the race and Sector analysis for the the practice and qualifying sessions. The main purpose of this project is to draw inferences on driver, team performance and startegy. 

About The files:
- The .ods files were generated by ourselves by taking the data form the FIA webpage
- THe Damini.ipynb is main python source code. Don't forget to put in the libraries ;)
- The png is juust the image of the singapore race track
- The pdf file is just there (I don't know why)...

Was a great project and was exciting to uncover facts!
